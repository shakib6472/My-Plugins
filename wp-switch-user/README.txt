Activate the plugin to automatically create a 'Switch To' link in the list of action links for each user. The 'Switch To' link allows administrators to visit a user's account without requiring the user's username and password. This plugin facilitates the quick swapping between user accounts.

Additionally, you can switch back to your original account using the provided 'Switch Back' button in the user's dashboard, admin bar, footer meta section, and instantly return to your admin panel.

Wp Switch User utilizes browser cookies to enable users to log in between accounts and creates a session to remember your old account, allowing you to switch back seamlessly. It unsets the session once the switch back is successful or if the current user logs out. This plugin incorporates the latest nonce security for links in WordPress.
